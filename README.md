### **Slide 3: Introduction**

**Welcome everyone.** Today, I will be presenting our real-time train timetable streaming pipeline for Velocity Railways. This solution is designed to provide accurate and real-time train departure information, improving both passenger experience and operational efficiency.

---

### **Slide 4: Problem Statement**

Velocity Railways faces key challenges that impact passenger satisfaction and operational effectiveness:

- **Lack of Real-Time Updates:** Passengers do not receive timely updates on delays or cancellations.
- **Data Quality Issues:** Inconsistent and incomplete real-time updates.
- **Single-Point Failures:** Outages occur when the primary database fails.
- **Lack of Monitoring:** No real-time monitoring or alerting for pipeline failures.

These issues lead to inefficiencies and a poor passenger experience.

---

### **Slide 5: Proposed Solution**

To address these challenges, we propose a **Real-Time Train Timetable Streaming Pipeline** that includes:

- **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Apache Flink (real-time) and Python requests (scheduled).
- **Data Validation:** Great Expectations ensures data quality.
- **Data Transformation:** Apache Beam processes, cleans, and enriches the data.
- **Data Storage:** Azure PostgreSQL (primary) and Local PostgreSQL (backup) for high availability.
- **Orchestration:** Apache Airflow manages the pipeline.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Airflow notifications detect failures.
- **End-User Applications:** Real-time dashboards and anomaly detection.

This architecture ensures a scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient system.

### **Slide 6: Technical Architecture**

Our pipeline follows a structured data flow:

- **TransportAPI â†’ Apache Flink (Real-time Data)**
- **TransportAPI â†’ Python requests (Scheduled Data)**
- **Apache Flink â†’ Great Expectations**
- **Python requests â†’ Great Expectations**
- **Great Expectations â†’ Apache Beam**
- **Apache Beam â†’ Azure PostgreSQL**
- **Apache Beam â†’ Local PostgreSQL**
- **Azure PostgreSQL â†’ Apache Airflow**
- **Local PostgreSQL â†’ Apache Airflow**
- **Apache Airflow â†’ Airflow Notifications**
- **Airflow Notifications â†’ Real-Time Dashboards**
- **Airflow Notifications â†’ Anomaly Detection**
- **Real-Time Dashboards â†’ End**
- **Anomaly Detection â†’ End**

(Insert flowchart visualization.)

### **Slide 7: Key Features**

This solution offers several essential features:

- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Provides up-to-the-minute train departure information.
- **Dynamic Data Validation:** Ensures data quality and consistency.
- **High Availability:** Dual database setup (Azure PostgreSQL and Local PostgreSQL).
- **Fault Tolerance:** Seamless failover to backup systems.
- **Real-Time Dashboards:** Enables dynamic decision-making.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies delays or cancellations in real-time.

---

### **Slide 8: Benefits**

Implementing this system will provide significant benefits:

- **Improved Passenger Experience:** Real-time updates on train departures.
- **Enhanced Data Quality:** Accurate and consistent data for decision-making.
- **High Availability:** Reduced downtime with backup systems.
- **Scalability:** Handles increasing data volumes.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Uses open-source tools (Apache Flink, Apache Beam, Great Expectations).
- **Real-Time Insights:** Enables proactive decision-making.

---

### **Slide 9: Next Steps**

To implement this system effectively, we propose the following roadmap:

- **Phase 1:** Build and deploy the pipeline (3 months).
- **Phase 2:** Integrate weather and social media data for enriched insights (2 months).
- **Phase 3:** Develop advanced anomaly detection models using machine learning (3 months).
- **Phase 4:** Expand to additional train stations and regions (ongoing).

This structured approach ensures a smooth transition and effective system rollout.

### **Slide 10: Q&A**

**Thank you for your time.** Iâ€™d now like to open the floor for any questions.

**Key Points for Handling Questions:**

- **Cost:** What is the investment required for this project?
- **Timeline:** How long will it take to implement?
- **Risks:** What are potential risks, and how will they be mitigated?

This concludes the presentation. **Thank you!** ðŸš†
